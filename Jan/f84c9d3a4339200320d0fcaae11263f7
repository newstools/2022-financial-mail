The death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu in December gripped the nation with an embrace of shock. Tutu’s death gives us cause to ponder how he touched our lives. His commitment to social justice and reconciliation, to human rights, and the dignity of people will be gratefully remembered. The world pays tribute to his immense and unique contribution to peace and justice, and his emphasis on the worth of every individual. His courage in denouncing international military intervention and his relentless fight against racism will be remembered by generations to come. We are devastated to lose our national symbol of truth, love and hope. Few individuals have had a greater impact. He is by any measure one of the most celebrated and inspiring leaders of his age. He was a rare breed: a passionate human rights defender who took on the mighty, the corrupt and the defiant in his crusade for global peace. The brilliant and sparkling light that illuminated our country and our global landscape amid darkness has gone out. Hamba kahle, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, beloved son of Africa, Nobel laureate, and apostle of peace and light in Africa. Farouk AraieBenoni The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
