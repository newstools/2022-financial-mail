Tony Ball of Gilletts  so regularly has letters published in the FM  that one might conclude he is either a member of staff (He’s not — Editor) or, in the current style, a “bot”. He recently drew attention (Letters, FM May 12-18)  to the responsibility of that  slush fund,  the Ingonyama Trust, as landlord, to effect repairs to the multitude of dwellings it  leases to  tenants. Those dwellings were damaged as a consequence of water,  diverted  by the mountains of litter that municipal employees have  failed to clear out of the ditches, gutters and similar contrivances designed to redirect  flood waters. Of course, there are  asinine pronouncements from on high that this wave of destruction was caused by global warming. It is convenient to place the blame for the floods on global warming and the leaders of the G7  nations, for this detracts from the actual litter on our streets.
