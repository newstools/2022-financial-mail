Over the years I have had dealings with Lyse Comins and always found her to be a professional  journalist who never pulled any punches. But after reading  “Durban Back in Business” (Fox, May 19-24), I am, first, convinced  that I live in a different Durban to the one she refers  to, and second,  inclined to report the article  for false advertising. Durban is, to put it plainly and simply, a mess — and a fancy R450m Ferris wheel and a Radisson  Blu hotel will not paper over the cracks. The city is riddled with infighting and  corruption, and with failing infrastructure  is on its deathbed. The task of finding a new city manager  has stalled, the council is broke and despite the best efforts of the DA, led by Nicole Graham,  progress in the city could be likened to sailors passing wind in  a tropical gale. Sorry, Lyse, I think you were wearing rose-coloured spectacles when you penned this one. Tony BallGillitts The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
