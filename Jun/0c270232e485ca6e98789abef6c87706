There is an ongoing tussle in SA between local poultry producers and  importers. In most cases, it is chicken portions with no market in the country of origin that are exported to  distant territories, like our country. So, tariffs are used to prevent  dumping. It is  interesting that poultry importers  often claim to  benefit  impoverished, hungry consumers. But  how do they expect the unemployed, suffering consumers to afford to buy their imported meat? The challenge for SA  is  rampant unemployment. That’s a problem that cannot be solved by importing  cheap goods and products. As a consumer and patriotic citizen, I prefer locally produced food, as it helps  create  jobs, and the financial benefits  cascade down to other role players,  boosting the local economy. It is a  disgrace that a country of more than 60-million people would  want to import things they can make or produce themselves. It’s  an economically myopic thing to do.
