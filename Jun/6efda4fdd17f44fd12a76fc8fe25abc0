SA’s champion looter must  be smiling at the moment. He has gone through a  range  of fall guys — Schabir [Shaik], [Carl] Niehaus, two high-ranking air force  members and no doubt many others — and the next two to be lined up  are  the Gupta brothers. If they don’t fit the bill,  we can be assured there is a  string of people already named in the Zondo reports who do. Their time has come to be thrown under the bus. Heh, heh, heh, heh.
