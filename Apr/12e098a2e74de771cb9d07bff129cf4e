On  March 15 2020, after a mere four weeks on campus as a first-year BA  student, I — along with every other person in the country — was told to stay at home until further notice. Now, 767 days later,  I am still waiting to be allowed to be back into an in-person lecture. If schools were able to return to in-person teaching, how can public universities keep their doors shut to  students — particularly with unreliable  access to electronics, power and the internet? Higher learning institutions are slowly —  I cannot but emphasise the slowness of their Covid response — allowing first years and postgraduates to return to  campus for in-person lectures. As a third-year student who has spent all this time online, I believe  R53,000 a year is a bit steep for slide shows and readings. The situation has been tough on the  2020 first years, who I believe are now being waited out while  new students are  prioritised. Still, the response to Covid by SA  universities has taught aspiring professionals such as myself a crucial characteristic of success: self-reliance.
