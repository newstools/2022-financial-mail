Julius Malema has done enough damage and  contributed  nothing except to get up everyone’s nose. Note how during the Covid pandemic he went MIA — just when he may have been able to do something to help. He went  quiet because he had exactly nothing to contribute from the EFF side. His most recent little rant and demonstration against SA’s most generous citizen is just the cherry on top. His poisonous racial rantings do nothing to help a country in crisis. He may have been amusing at some point, but his “work” — performing disruptions and sowing hatred — should now be over. Peter Gordon GrantSedgefield The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
