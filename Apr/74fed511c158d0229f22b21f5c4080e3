With the SA Revenue Service  having raked in an extra R314bn, it is, I suppose, too much to expect of the ANC to  put a substantial portion of that additional tax income into Eskom. Doing so  would reduce the interest paid by Eskom —  interest that is a  major burden the  company bears due to the incompetence and corruption of its past, ANC-appointed leaders. No doubt the  extra income will be frittered away on vote-buying largesse instead of offering  real, long-term benefit to all the people of our country.
