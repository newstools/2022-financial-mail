BUY/Standard Bank We were slightly underweight the banks so we are picking up banking shares opportunistically. We still like Standard Bank  a lot. There are a few elements: first,  ending the  lockdown  should help economic activity improve. Don’t expect anything meaningful, but an improvement would require finance to support it. Then, if you look at  interest rates  going higher, that will benefit banks. And we think  SA’s banks are trading at price-to-book ratios,  essentially pricing in a no-growth scenario — that they’ll only just meet their cost of capital. SELL/Adcock Ingram and Aspen We’ve been trimming our positions in Adcock and Aspen. We sold meaningful parcels of our positions in Adcock and Aspen. In Adcock’s case, it’s come from the R40s to the R50s — and we struggle to see the strategic direction that would make a meaningful impact on future growth.  It still  has  Bidvest as a shareholder and maybe  that’s holding the business back a bit.  It has also been able to capture some of the Covid upside, but we think that’s going to come to an end. Aspen stock basically ran ahead of itself. It has been very good at marketing around the vaccine, but  take-up doesn’t seem to be good and people are becoming reluctant to get  their jabs. We think  it is unlikely to realise meaningful value in the scale of vaccinations expected.
