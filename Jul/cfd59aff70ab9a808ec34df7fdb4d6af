Nick Kunze, portfolio manager: Sanlam Private Wealth BUY: KAP Industrial Holdings The business was severely  affected by Covid but  it has planned quite high  capex over the next  three years and  debt doesn’t seem to be a problem. For those who want small-cap SA exposure, we really like the business. It operates in the industrials,  chemicals and logistics sectors and if you look at chemicals especially, prices are really strong and  it’s making high margins. The stock trades at a 6.5 forward p:e and we see this being at least a  10 times  p:e business, so for that reason alone the valuation is  compelling.   SELL: Telkom It’s a bit out of left field but we’ve never liked Telkom and given the possible deal with MTN, we think  the money has been made there. MTN is obviously going to take the juicier bits of the business such as the fibre division, and the only thing that might be interesting as a spin-off is  its property portfolio — it could be worth a bit. But  Telkom has been disappointing for shareholders, so MTN is a bit of a get out of jail free card:  take the profits now and run.
