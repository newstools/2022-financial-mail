Last week’s  challenge from Action Society’s Ian Cameron to police minister Bheki Cele in Cape Town refers. Few who watched Cameron’s deeply frustrated but elegant and  impassioned speech to the minister could disagree with his views or his motives. But we  must all surely view the response — from the minister and the police —  as deeply inappropriate and irresponsible. Being told to “shut up” is bad enough, but to be  threatened and frogmarched out of the building  is beyond the pale. This is the reality of how  Cele’s goons deal with honest and passionate criticism. This is what the man  known as “The Stuffed Hat” orders his  jackboots to do when a frustrated  citizen speaks truth to power. Straight out of Oswald Mosley’s blackshirt playbook.   And where is our president in all of this?  Where is a single dissenting voice in the ANC? And where is the DA shadow minister who replaced the effective and impressive Dianne Kohler Barnard? All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men and women to do nothing. Ian Cameron cannot be left alone and unprotected. For shame. Mark LoweDurban The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
