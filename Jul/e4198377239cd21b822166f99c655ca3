Had an  ANC government ruled in the UK, with Jacob Zuma as prime  minister,  how long would it have lasted? Conversely, had the Conservative Party under Boris Johnson ruled in SA, how long would that have lasted? Easy answer: Zuma would have been out on his ear after one term in the UK. Johnson,  on the other hand,   would still be  in power in SA, despite turning a blind eye to the misdemeanours of a few cabinet ministers. What Johnson  is guilty of is chicken feed compared  with what Zuma orchestrated here. But the  reason for the vastly different outcomes is clear. The British electorate through its elected parliamentarians — and  the ballot box — shows its disapproval. In Johnson’s case, even his own “cadres” voted him out.   In SA, the electorate and opposition parties don’t possess the political will to force change. We’ve been mesmerised into believing  the promises made in 1994 are still in the offing. Unlike the Brits, we’re in denial. And we’re paying dearly for it. Cliff BuchlerClaremont The FM welcomes concise letters from readers. They can be sent to fmmail@fm.co.za
