As an ordinary South African, having lived here for more than 50 years, I cannot understand what all the fuss is about over the River Club development. It seems to me that the new development  is a good thing that will benefit the city and provide  jobs as well as  new sites for running and walking. Is there any valid reason to halt the building at this stage? What benefit will that bring to any person in Cape Town? Chris Howe-ElyCape Town The FM welcomes concise letters from readers.
