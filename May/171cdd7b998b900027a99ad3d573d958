This year Africa Day, which was celebrated on May 25, coincided with the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. At this event, African leaders and other world leaders gathered to discuss  issues of importance to the continent and the rest of the world. One of the critical matters that Africa must address is how the continent tackles climate change, and the role that the public and private sector will play in addressing this and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. In honour of Africa Day, and its theme of “Strengthening resilience in nutrition and food security on the African continent”, Africa.com's Teresa Clarke had the opportunity to speak to  Borge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, and Sim Tshabalala, CEO of the Standard Bank Group, about how Africa's governments and largest companies can, and will, move forward on addressing ESG issues.
