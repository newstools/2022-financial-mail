SA business and government leaders are at a unique point. We have sky-high unemployment, a rapidly evolving fourth industrial revolution and generational differences in our human capital that we  ignore at our peril. We should future-proof our growth by building  retention, succession and advancement into  human capital plans across the public and private sectors. If today’s advances in digital and artificial intelligence (AI) tools have shown us anything, it is that humans are not machines. Our human capital cannot be always and permanently “on”; we want to make a lasting impact, but can’t burn out while doing it. In a pilot study IQbusiness conducted in late 2021, nearly 70% of office-based staff in SA reported functioning under extreme stress. One of the immediate steps leaders can take to ease the  risk of burnout is to live the example of switching off: the  AI tools at our disposal mean  we can schedule e-mails to only send during working hours; we can encourage responsible time management, with regular outdoor and exercise breaks in a working day; and  we can take care to remember that a kind phone call or cup of coffee remains the best way to connect. As we shape and reshape our evolving realities, each of us can use  AI tools  to make smarter choices in how and when we work. But it remains up to the  people in our system to ensure this work fosters a sense of connection and purpose, rather than  dysfunction and exhaustion.
