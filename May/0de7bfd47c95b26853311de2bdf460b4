The expected  fifth wave of Covid is making its presence felt and medical experts are warning of the potentially dire consequences of a new variant  sweeping across the country. The government must, as a matter of urgency, invoke new measures to enforce compliance with the preventive rules, which are being brazenly ignored.  Unless we as a nation exercise strict personal control, the chances of containing the wave, let alone defeating it, are diminished. We cannot afford a new hard lockdown — the cost will be astronomical. A new lockdown will shatter our economic wellbeing, and poverty will escalate. We  will pay the price if we ignore  safety rules and regulations; such  folly will lead to hardship, discomfort, hunger and death. The safety and future of SA  is in our hands.
