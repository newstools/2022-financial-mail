As an online subscriber, I’m a longtime admirer of the  FM as a commentator on matters of socioeconomic importance. There was also a time when I enjoyed reading the humorous quips on the back page. Sadly, Chris Roper’s column about DA leader  John Steenhuisen’s  trip to Ukraine (The adventures of John Steenhuisen in Ukraine, May 12-18), while perhaps amusing to some, was neither funny nor appropriate considering  the  tragic circumstances that surround both  Ukraine and SA. Unlike  SA’s president, Steenhuisen has had the foresight, common sense and guts to visit a country that has been illegally, dishonestly and barbarically invaded by one of SA’s close geopolitical associates and fellow Brics  member, Russia. The consequences of this aggression is being felt deeply, not only by  Ukrainians  but  around the world — including in SA, where the prices of fuel, foodstuffs and many other products are climbing sharply. I salute Steenhuisen and whichever SA private sector institutions funded his fact-finding mission. They have done what the SA government and President Cyril Ramaphosa have not had the decency or  common sense to do. By their neglect, Ramaphosa and his  cabinet have  placed themselves firmly on the side of Russia’s dictator and criminal oligarchy. The FM would do well to invite experts to comment on issues surrounding Russia and its war on Ukraine. Better still, I believe you should undertake some proper  research by visiting both Russia and  Ukraine. I am sure any editorials or articles that flow from that would  do the image and reputation of the FM a power of good, and  assist SA in overcoming  the huge socioeconomic hurdles that confront us.
