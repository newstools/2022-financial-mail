The killing of  Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by Israeli forces is an act of savagery the so-called civilised world must stridently condemn, as it has  denounced the fighting in Ukraine. Killing in such a manner is tantamount to  murder. Murdering a journalist is the ultimate form of censorship. Yet journalists continue to  pay the  price for speaking truth to power. More than 2,500  have been killed since 1990; many more have been jailed — another  form of intimidation. When journalists are killed, democracy dies. Which is why ending impunity for crimes against journalists is one of the most pressing issues to guarantee freedom of expression and access to information for all. When you silence the messenger, catastrophe is the price humanity pays.
